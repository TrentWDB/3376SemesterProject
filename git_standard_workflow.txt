In order to commit changes:
git status (to see what all you've changed)
git add -u (to add all updated)
git add File.h (to add a file)
git rm File.h (to remove a file)
git status (to be sure you got everything staged)
git commit -m "short message describing what you did"

If you're trying to update your code to match the server you say:
[be sure you have all your changes committed]
git fetch origin master (to copy origin master to your local origin/master)
git merge origin/master (to put your changes on top of origin/master)

If you're trying to push your code to the server:
[be sure you have merged origin/master]
git push origin master (to push your changes to the server)


Overall:
git status
git add -u
git add NewFile.h
git commit -m "added NewFile.h and edited OldFile.h"
git fetch origin master
git merge origin/master
git push origin master
